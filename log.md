# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today, pondering why Twitter Bootstrap is so popular and learning about CSS grid systems from the ground up. Have finished the tutorial on chapter 16 from the book "CSS: the missing manual" and messing around the Skeleton framework, an alternative to Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** I've been working through this book before starting 100 days of code and its really helping explain the intricacies of CSS in easy to understand chunks. To anyone that says CSS is easy - I say, F you! CSS is complex and powerful in its own right. I want to take a CSS first approach to other projects before relying on JavaScript in future.

### Day 2: January 2, 2017
**Today's Progress**: revisted my Jekyll Blog and played around with the Skeleton CSS framework some more. I may re-write my blog to use the skeleton framework as practice.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I know will be hard to find time to code, but I thinking of messing around with Flexbox next.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I only got to get code for 15 mins on Jan 3rd so I'm carrying it over to Jan 4th. I started on question 5 of Project Euler, trying to get a a nested for loop within a while to work but hitting some errors...grrr

**Thoughts:**: This is the hardest thing about programming ,getting stuck and not being sure why. I've been focusing a lot of CSS recently and writing up markup . Jumping straight into some Python after a little while is a bit of a shock to the system. Will mess around with the the logic a bit more tomomorrow then go back to finishing my CSS work and play with Flexbox.

### Day 4: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I think i've finally cracked question 5 of Project Euler, its taking longer than 5 secs to work out. So need to refine the logic somemore . I'm just happy i got the while loop working correctly, so in my eyes its still a success . I've taken a brute for approach to solving the questions which clearly isnt efficent .  

**Thoughts:**:  I  dontthink my maths is good enough to efficently work on project Euler . If i carry on with more Project Euler questions this will become #100daysofProjectEuler. Will definetly go back to web dev tomorrow and at last- Flexbox!!

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
