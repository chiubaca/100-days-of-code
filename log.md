# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today, pondering why Twitter Bootstrap is so popular and learning about CSS grid systems from the ground up. Have finished the tutorial on chapter 16 from the book "CSS: the missing manual" and messing around the Skeleton framework, an alternative to Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** I've been working through this book before starting 100 days of code and its really helping explain the intricacies of CSS in easy to understand chunks. To anyone that says CSS is easy - I say, F you! CSS is complex and powerful in its own right. I want to take a CSS first approach to other projects before relying on JavaScript in future.

### Day 2: January 2, 2017
**Today's Progress**: revisted my Jekyll Blog and played around with the Skeleton CSS framework some more. I may re-write my blog to use the skeleton framework as practice.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I know will be hard to find time to code, but I thinking of messing around with Flexbox next.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I only got to code for 15 mins on today so I'm carrying it over to Jan 4th. I started on question 5 of Project Euler, trying to get a a nested for loop within a while loop to work but hitting some errors...grrr

**Thoughts:**: This is the hardest thing about programming, getting stuck and not being sure why. I've been focusing a lot of CSS recently and writing markup . Jumping straight into some Python after a little while is a bit of a shock to the system. Will mess around with the the logic a bit more tomomorrow then go back to finishing my CSS work and play with Flexbox.

### Day 4: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I think i've finally cracked question 5 of Project Euler, its taking longer than 5 secs to compute. So need to refine the logic somemore. I'm just happy I got the while loop working correctly, so in my eyes its still a success . I've taken a brute for approach to solving the questions which clearly isnt efficent, but HEY!  

**Thoughts:**:  I dont think my maths is good enough to efficently work on project Euler . If i carry on with more Project Euler questions this will become #100daysofProjectEuler. Will definetly go back to web dev tomorrow and at last- Flexbox!!

### Day 5: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed my code for Project Euler and added some additonal code so i can track how long it takes to run. It takes far to long to compute! Need to understand how to write more elegant algorithms. 

**Thoughts:**: Today was tough. Sleep deprived due to no heating in my house. Forced my self just to code for a little bit. think i managed 20 mins which I'm a bit annoyed about. This challenge is harder than anticipated when trying to juggle all of other lifes problems and commitments . Determined to battle through this though.

### Day 6: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not too much coding, but learnt a lot about flexbox. Want to hack around with it a bit more, but seems really useful . can't wait to implement its functionality into my blog.  Also discovered this neat tool to add vendor prefixes to your CSS
<https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer>

**Thoughts:**: Another busy day and tough to sqeeze in the time to for coding but I am least trying to look at code everyday even if it is not for one hour

**Link to work:** n/a

### Day 7: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent more of today learning about Flexbox and also general CSS best practice. In summary of stuff i've learnt:
- Do use css reset or normalise.css
- avoid classistis (using too many classes)
- try to use decedent selectors whenever you can
- breaking up css into different css files can help organise your css and make it more managable
- join mutiple css files into one "gatekeeper" or base.css file using the import class
- do reference multiple classes if required . great for reducing css


**Thoughts:**:Spent over 2 hours reading and learning about Flexbox and various CSS things. This makes up for hot hitting 1 hours the others days this week . Mind drifted a few times to other coding projects. One in particular [magic mirror]<http://blog.dylanjpierce.com/raspberrypi/magicmirror/tutorial/2015/12/27/build-a-magic-mirror.html> ..... Maybe later!! must stay focused :)

### Day 8: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Had this wacky idea to find a way to automate my 100 days of code counter in my twitter bio. was looking around for ways to do this and found Tweepy a twitter Python API. Lots of people seem to recomend it around the internet . Have got the update bio method working on a test twitter account . Wouldnt it be funny if my bio could tell the weather too? heh. been looking at the open weather API. will hack around with it tomorrow.


**Thoughts:**: uh oh .. im getting distracted from my css work... at least i'm having fun though. I never thought i would be able to hack around with code like this. It feels good though.

**Link to work:** uploading soon


### Day 9: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made some progress with this little python script to automate my 100 days of code ticker. I'm hosting it on Pythonanywhere.com which is a greate service to run python apps and scripts , in the free model i can run 1 script once a day which is great for this little project. Also worked out how to print emojis using unicode which was tricker than anticipated. Still a little confused around unicode but its working! somehow.


**Thoughts:**: I'm having fun with this little side project I am aiming to get this completed by tommorrow and hopefully post a tweet about it. once I'm done i will finish off my CSS book and begin hacking with my jekyll blog and try to theme it.

**Today's Progress**: Success with my automation script and have set it as a scheduled task on PythonAnywhere(great cloud service!). Twitter account now automatically updates my 100 days of code counter and my name updates with the current weather powered by Open Weather Map. 

**Thoughts:**: Had great fun with this mini project I need to do more things like this as I learn so much doing. I must get back to CSS and starting learning how to theme my blog. 

**Link to work:** uploading soon

### Day 12: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Just a little work on my automation script. implemented a continuous while loop which could replace the scheduled task

**Today's Progress**: I have finished the JS fundamentals course on Code school and feel a lot more confident looking and working with JS and JSON . Its been a great course . Learnt so much, the begining was slow , relearning  operatoros and how loops works. But the later part of the course i was really interesting and have a good understanding of inheritence ,  how JS compiles , constructor , prototypes , over-riding prototype. These concepts i have seen but never really understood until now. Ready to start hacking around with JS project. currently looking at how canvas works . 

**Thoughts:** feeling better about my JS skills  

### Day 54: Febuary 26, 2017

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 57: March 2, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Got an idea for a pollution web map idea using Kings College Pollution API but not sure which technology to use yet to implement. I want to be a be able to draw a line and build a profile of pollution levels.

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 58: March 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through plurasight mapbox lessons

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 59: March 4, 2017

**Thoughts:**

### Day 62: March 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: feel like i need to learn a bit more about leaflet works - starting to read leafelt tips and tricks and working through examples

**Thoughts:** 


### Day 63: March 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reading leafelt tips and tricks and working through examples , still looking at methods to build this pollution map.

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 64: March 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reading leafelt tips and tricks and working through examples , still looking at methods to build this pollution map. Found some examples of how to return a point and raster value using the ArcGIS JS api... should i switch to the JS API instead?? 

**Thoughts:** : feeling confused as to what APi i should focus my attention.. i dont want to reinvent the wheel doing this. but at the same should i try to!? it would be good learning experience . learning an API is strange completely different from learning core JS,  feel like need more JS training!?

### Day 65: March 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: read through a little bit more of leaflet tips and tricks , then started to trying to hack this mapbox app -https://www.mapbox.com/blog/introducing-the-surface-api/

**Thoughts:** feeling like i'm making no progress with this... I need to refocus. am i biting off more than i can chew with this project? maybe i should start smalling and work out how to build a really simple with the pollution web map api first... 

1) finisih leafelt tips and tricks
2) build a basic webmap with the air pollution api
3) add on layers to switch between the pollution layers
4)??

### Day 66: March 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: currently still reading through leaflet tips and tricks and messing aroung with leaflet plugins... no real progres on the pollution map

**Thoughts:** just learning leaflet , still counts!


### Day 67: March 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: finished leaflet tips and tricks, moving on to some youtube tutorials

**Thoughts:** 


### Day 68: March 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: still watching youtube videos about leaflet and messing around around with it on codepen. its starting to click now.

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 69: March 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  finished a the leaflet youtube tutorials , i'm just playing around with the framework now experiementing with how it works . also started reading eloquent javascript . only read the first chapter but i like it!

**Thoughts:** to learn code , you just gotta code!


### Day 70: March 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: trying to pick up this pollution idea again , looking at how i can make an arcgis JS code example and how I can refactor it to fit the leaflet framework. Just want to carry on messing around with leaflet somemore so that i feel more comfortable with the framework.

**Thoughts:** feeling more confident i can make this pollution map. baby steps. solve one little problem at a time.



### Day 71: March 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: almost finished these leaflet tutorials on youtube and am getting a better grasp of the leaflet api, just needs some hands on practise and should be there

**Thoughts:** 


### Day 72: April 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: spent over 6 hours coding today. progess with my leaflet pollution map. got layers displaying by intergrating esri leaflet plugin and learning AJAX for API request to london air pollution.

**Thoughts:** more than made up for lack of coding this week today. really enjoying learning about ajax pretty interesting and need to try and implement it into my app now. feeling hopeful i can actually build this danm thing!


### Day 73: April 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: learning more about AJAX calls ,following some tutorials

**Thoughts:**


### Day 75: April 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: missed a few days of coding, so busy at work! still learning about how AJAX calls work . 

**Thoughts:**

### Day 76: April 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: understand how AJAX calls better , coding a little app for practice. It injects HTML into a DIV and clears the all elements afterwards. 

**Thoughts:** : enjoying learning about DOM manipulation using Javascript , pretty cool.


### Day 77: April 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: little practise app is working well , need to refactor the AJAX logic and implement it into my air pollution map

**Thoughts:**

**link to work:** http://codepen.io/chiubaca/pen/dvEZBQ



### Day 78: April 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  implemented AJAX logic into air pollution map and also ability for the webapp to clear HTML elements after each click of the map.  Wherever you click on the map it will return the No2 and O3 pollution levels. The CSS needs a lot of work!! need to upload the code to github for proper version control.

**Thoughts:**really chuffed I have been able to implement the AJAX logic and ability to clear the HTML after each click. Still a long way off from creating the pollution profiles but progress is progress.

**link to work:** http://codepen.io/chiubaca/pen/peGoVa


### Day 79: April 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Not too much work done . ported code off codepen and uploaded it to github . started looking at the CSS and realised i have forgotten everything!! nooooo.......  All i remember is floats lol.

**Thoughts:** Coding on my birthday week. I must really enjoy coding now! Need to revise my CSS, but will keep the design simple for this application. With the main logic in place i can focus on the look and feel of the application. which might prove to more challenging...

### Day 80: April 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Thinking more about the CSS design of the app and investigating some charting librarys to bring the application to life. also udpated about 2 weeks worth of these logs, whoops. Too busy coding to document my progress.

**Thoughts:** CSS is BITCH, cant get anything to work. want to work on the chart visualisation instead.

### Day 81: April 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Learning some SVG concepts via http://svgtutorial.com/ , seeing how i can implements some graphs into the air pollution map

### Day 82: April 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  More SVG concepts via http://svgtutorial.com/ , seeing how i can implements some graphs into the air pollution map

### Day 83: April 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: playing around with d3 and going through tutorials on plurasight

### Day 84: April 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: playing around with d3 some more and going through tutorials on plurasight

### Day 85: April 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: more d3 practise and got some basic graphs working in d3

**Thoughts**: d3 is clearly powerful as  it allow for svg manipulation with JavaScript, tutorials on plurasight are great, and i want to carry on learning d3. but for a quick win for my air pollution map i'm going to explore a charting library like chart.js. Seems quicker to implement a good looking chart. 

### Day 86: April 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: started reading up on chart JS, looks really easy to use - the boiler plate code was easy enought to get started with and all i need to do is work how to add the pollution into an array and refresh the chart and that should be dandy!!

**Thoughts**: wprk on d3 has made me really appreciate how awesome a library like chartjs is. clean and straight forward to use the abstraction is done so well I can focus on trying to get my data to work with the chart and i dont need to learn how to build charts from the ground up.

**link to work** : http://codepen.io/chiubaca/pen/PmzOYR


### Day 76: April 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: more work on chart js. good progress . got a radial charts working and got a POC to show how data refreshes work. it looks great too. loving chartjs . need to refactor the code to work with the pollution map now

**Thoughts**: making progress!! I love it. think i can get this map and dyanamic chart built before the end of this challenge 

**link to work** : http://codepen.io/chiubaca/pen/pPbMWR


### Day 77: April 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: successfully implemented Chart JS into Web map and it looks  goood!! now to work on some of the UI UX

**Thoughts**:surprised by how quickly i did this. I underestimated my skills :D muhaha .

**link to work** : http://codepen.io/chiubaca/pen/pPbMWR


### Day 78: April 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: redoing some of the CSS - surprising i still remember my css stuff from way back when ifirst started this challenge.

**Thoughts**: working out how to make this look "good" is surprising tricky and trying to get css to do what i want is as hard as ever. maybe i will master this properly one day.

**link to work** : http://codepen.io/chiubaca/pen/pPbMWR


### Day 79: April 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  still working on the design on this - practising my css on a different codepen

**Thoughts**: revising css again . but its coming back to me much quicker

**link to work** : http://codepen.io/chiubaca/pen/dWOREz

### Day 80: April 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  design of the  web app is starting to take shape but its still pretty clunky, i'm adding in media queries to make it more mobile friendly

**link to work** : http://codepen.io/chiubaca/pen/YVZYpV

### Day 81: April 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  implented some cool cloud animations- forked from somewhere else. Just a bit of fun . Think it looks pretty good.

**link to work** : http://codepen.io/chiubaca/pen/YVZYpV

### Day 82: April 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  fafing around with more of the desgin on the webapp- maybe this is taking a bit too long? 

**Thoughts:** Thought it was cool London Air DM on twitter today asking how i was implementing the query in my map. cant wait to share this with the world.

**link to work** : http://codepen.io/chiubaca/pen/YVZYpV


### Day 83: April 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  media queries implemented but still looks goofy. 

**Thoughts:** UI UX sure is hard. just cant seem to make this looks good. Plus the chartJS canvas element just doenst want to play ball....

**link to work** : http://codepen.io/chiubaca/pen/YVZYpV

### Day 84: April 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  media queries implemented but still looks goofy. 

**Thoughts:** UI UX sure is hard. just cant seem to make this looks good. Plus the chartJS canvas element just doenst want to play ball....

**link to work** : http://codepen.io/chiubaca/pen/YVZYpV


### Day 85: April 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  more work on css media queries

**Thoughts:** still looks crappy after so much work....

**link to work** : http://codepen.io/chiubaca/pen/YVZYpV



### Day 86: May 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: time for a design rethink. looking into implementing a leaflet plugin https://github.com/Turbo87/leaflet-sidebar . this p[lugin looks solid and I can put the chart into the element inside there and it should look cleaner.

### Day 93: May 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Putting a pen in this project for a while - decided to call this a pre-alpha. and put up on the internet. Still needs a lot more features to be added but I'll like to focus on some other aspect of coding now. perhaps Git version control, Docker, learn some more about Linux . Need to have a think about what will be the most useful. 

**Today's Progress**: Last week of coding to go !
