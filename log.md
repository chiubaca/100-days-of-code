# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today, pondering why Twitter Bootstrap is so popular and learning about CSS grid systems from the ground up. Have finished the tutorial on chapter 16 from the book "CSS: the missing manual" and messing around the Skeleton framework, an alternative to Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** I've been working through this book before starting 100 days of code and its really helping explain the intricacies of CSS in easy to understand chunks. To anyone that says CSS is easy - I say, F you! CSS is complex and powerful in its own right. I want to take a CSS first approach to other projects before relying on JavaScript in future.

### Day 2: January 2, 2017
**Today's Progress**: revisted my Jekyll Blog and played around with the Skeleton CSS framework some more. I may re-write my blog to use the skeleton framework as practice.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I know will be hard to find time to code, but I thinking of messing around with Flexbox next.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I only got to get code for 15 mins on Jan 3rd so I'm carrying it over to Jan 4th. I started on question 5 of Project Euler, trying to get a a nested for loop within a while to work but hitting some errors...grrr

**Thoughts:**: This is the hardest thing about programming ,getting stuck and not being sure why. I've been focusing a lot of CSS recently and writing up markup . Jumping straight into some Python after a little while is a bit of a shock to the system. Will mess around with the the logic a bit more tomomorrow then go back to finishing my CSS work and play with Flexbox.

### Day 4: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I think i've finally cracked question 5 of Project Euler, its taking longer than 5 secs to work out. So need to refine the logic somemore . I'm just happy i got the while loop working correctly, so in my eyes its still a success . I've taken a brute for approach to solving the questions which clearly isnt efficent .  

**Thoughts:**:  I  dont think my maths is good enough to efficently work on project Euler . If i carry on with more Project Euler questions this will become #100daysofProjectEuler. Will definetly go back to web dev tomorrow and at last- Flexbox!!

### Day 5: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed my code for Project Euler and added some additonal code so i track how long it takes to run. It takes far to long to compute! Need to understand how to write more elegant algorithms. 

**Thoughts:**: Today was tough. Sleep deprived due to no heating in my house. Forced my self just to code for a little bit. think i managed 20 mins which I'm a bit annoyed about. This challenge is harder than anticipated when trying to juggle all of other lifes problems and commitments . Determined to battle through though.
