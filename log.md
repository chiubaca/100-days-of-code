# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today, pondering why Twitter Bootstrap is so popular and learning about CSS grid systems from the ground up. Have finished the tutorial on chapter 16 from the book "CSS: the missing manual" and messing around the Skeleton framework, an alternative to Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** I've been working through this book before starting 100 days of code and its really helping explain the intricacies of CSS in easy to understand chunks. To anyone that says CSS is easy - I say, F you! CSS is complex and powerful in its own right. I want to take a CSS first approach to other projects before relying on JavaScript in future.

### Day 2: January 2, 2017
**Today's Progress**: revisted my Jekyll Blog and played around with the Skeleton CSS framework some more. I may re-write my blog to use the skeleton framework as practice.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I know will be hard to find time to code, but I thinking of messing around with Flexbox next.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I only got to code for 15 mins on today so I'm carrying it over to Jan 4th. I started on question 5 of Project Euler, trying to get a a nested for loop within a while loop to work but hitting some errors...grrr

**Thoughts:**: This is the hardest thing about programming, getting stuck and not being sure why. I've been focusing a lot of CSS recently and writing markup . Jumping straight into some Python after a little while is a bit of a shock to the system. Will mess around with the the logic a bit more tomomorrow then go back to finishing my CSS work and play with Flexbox.

### Day 4: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I think i've finally cracked question 5 of Project Euler, its taking longer than 5 secs to compute. So need to refine the logic somemore. I'm just happy I got the while loop working correctly, so in my eyes its still a success . I've taken a brute for approach to solving the questions which clearly isnt efficent, but HEY!  

**Thoughts:**:  I dont think my maths is good enough to efficently work on project Euler . If i carry on with more Project Euler questions this will become #100daysofProjectEuler. Will definetly go back to web dev tomorrow and at last- Flexbox!!

### Day 5: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed my code for Project Euler and added some additonal code so i can track how long it takes to run. It takes far to long to compute! Need to understand how to write more elegant algorithms. 

**Thoughts:**: Today was tough. Sleep deprived due to no heating in my house. Forced my self just to code for a little bit. think i managed 20 mins which I'm a bit annoyed about. This challenge is harder than anticipated when trying to juggle all of other lifes problems and commitments . Determined to battle through this though.

### Day 6: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not too much coding, but learnt a lot about flexbox. Want to hack around with it a bit more, but seems really useful . can't wait to implement its functionality into my blog.  Also discovered this neat tool to add vendor prefixes to your CSS
<https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer>

**Thoughts:**: Another busy day and tough to sqeeze in the time to for coding but I am least trying to look at code everyday even if it is not for one hour

### Day 7: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent more of today learning about Flexbox and also general CSS best practice. In summary of stuff i've learnt:
- Do use css reset or normalise.css
- avoid classistis (using too many classes)
- try to use decedent selectors whenever you can
- breaking up css into different css files can help organise your css and make it more managable
- join mutiple css files into one "gatekeeper" or base.css file using the import class
- do reference multiple classes if required . great for reducing css


**Thoughts:**:Spent over 2 hours reading and learning about Flexbox and various CSS things. This makes up for hot hitting 1 hours the others days this week . Mind drifted a few times to other coding projects. One in particular [magic mirror]<http://blog.dylanjpierce.com/raspberrypi/magicmirror/tutorial/2015/12/27/build-a-magic-mirror.html> ..... Maybe later!! must stay focused :)

### Day 8: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Had this wacky idea to find a way to automate my 100 days of code counter in my twitter bio. was looking around for ways to do this and found Tweepy a twitter Python API. Lots of people seem to recomend it around the internet . Have got the update bio method working on a test twitter account . Wouldnt it be funny if my bio could tell the weather too? heh. been looking at the open weather API. will hack around with it tomorrow.


**Thoughts:**: uh oh .. im getting distracted from my css work... at least i'm having fun though. I never thought i would be able to hack around with code like this. It feels good though.

### Day 9: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made some progress with this little python script to automate my 100 days of code ticker. I'm hosting it on Pythonanywhere.com which is a greate service to run python apps and scripts , in the free model i can run 1 script once a day which is great for this little project. Also worked out how to print emojis using unicode which was tricker than anticipated. Still a little confused around unicode but its working! somehow.


**Thoughts:**: I'm having fun with this little side project I am aiming to get this completed by tommorrow and hopefully post a tweet about it. once I'm done i will finish off my CSS book and begin hacking with my jekyll blog and try to theme it.

**Thoughts:**: So close to getting this working

### Day 11: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Success with my automation script and have set it as a scheduled task on PythonAnywhere(great cloud service!). Twitter account now automatically updates my 100 days of code counter and my name updates with the current weather powered by Open Weather Map. 

**Thoughts:**: Had great fun with this mini project I need to do more things like this as I learn so much doing. I must get back to CSS and starting learning how to theme my blog.

### Day 12: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Just a little work on my automation script. implemented a continuous while loop which could replace the scheduled task

**Thoughts:**: busy travelling today so not much coding managed to sqeeze in a little work though

### Day 13: January 14, 2017

### Day 14: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: spent a few hours learning about sass some more . seems really powerful , but need to spend some time with to get a feel for it.

**Thoughts:**: not much coding again, just lots of reading. will be rebuilding an old website with sass next.
